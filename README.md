# Welcome to DBT Core Project!

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with your dbt project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dbt by following the [installation instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).
3. Initialize your dbt project by running the following command in your project directory:

    ```bash
    dbt init
    ```

4. Configure your database connection details in the `profiles.yml` file located in the `.dbt` directory. Refer to [Snowflake Setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/snowflake-setup) for guidance.

    ```yml
    # ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
    # refer to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/snowflake-setup

    dbt_project:
      target: dev
      outputs:
        dev:
          type: snowflake
          user: <user>
          account: <account_name>
          password: <password>
          role: <role>
          database: <database>
          warehouse: <warehouse>
          schema: <schema>
          threads: 4
          client_session_keep_alive: False
          query_tag: dbt
          # The following line is used to specify the default schema for the target database.
          schema: dbt_project
          # The following line is used to specify the default database for the target database.
    ```

5. Run your first dbt commands:

    ```bash
    dbt run
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    dbt test
    ```

## Project Structure

Your dbt project follows a structured organization to manage your data transformations effectively. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

1. **analyses**: Contains SQL files for ad-hoc queries and analyses.
2. **dbt_packages**: Used for storing custom packages or macros.
3. **logs**: Stores log files generated by dbt commands.
4. **macros**: Contains reusable SQL code snippets (macros) for common patterns or logic.
5. **models**: Holds your dbt models, which define transformations on your data.
6. **seeds**: Defines seed data, small datasets used as starting points for transformations.
7. **snapshots**: Contains snapshot models, capturing the state of your data at specific points in time.
8. **target**: Stores compiled SQL files, run results, and metadata generated during dbt execution.
9. **tests**: Contains test SQL files to ensure data transformations produce expected results.

## Project Configuration

Here's the configuration for your dbt project:

```yml
# Name, Version, and Config-Version:
name: "dbt_project" #Specifies the name of the dbt project. It should contain only lowercase characters and underscores.
version: "1.0.0" #Specifies the version of the dbt project.
config-version: 2 # Indicates the version of the dbt configuration format being used. Version 2 is the current version.

# Specifies the name of the profile to use from the profiles.yml file. The profile contains connection details for the target data warehouse.
profile: "dbt_project"

# File Paths
model-paths: ["models"] #Directory containing model SQL files.
analysis-paths: ["analyses"] #Directory containing analysis SQL files.
test-paths: ["tests"] #Directory containing test SQL files.
seed-paths: ["seeds"] #Directory containing seed data files.
macro-paths: ["macros"] #Directory containing macro SQL files.
snapshot-paths: ["snapshots"] #Directory containing snapshot SQL files.

# Clean Targets
# Specifies the directories to be removed by the dbt clean command. This command removes generated artifacts from these directories.
clean-targets:
  - "target"
  - "dbt_packages"

# Configuring Models
# This section configures how dbt should handle models. Models are SQL files that define transformations on data.
models:
  dbt_project:
    example:
      +materialized: view
```
